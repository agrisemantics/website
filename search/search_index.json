These recommendations are high-level, to encourage researchers and practitioners to extend them according to their area of expertise. The activities of the Agrisemantics WG started off with an analysis of the current landscape of use of semantic resources with agricultural data , based on first-hand experience of our group members, as well as on bibliometric investigation, and an analysis of existing repositories. From that first activity, we found that despite the many possible applications of semantics and the interest shown by research and industry alike, their actual implementation and use is lagging behind. A large number of resources are not in machine-readable formats or do not have public APIs, while those available are often used beyond their intended area of use, possibly leading to problems. Our conclusion is that there is a strong need for \u201clifting\u201d semantic resources to the web, and create new ones appropriate to their intended use. Based on the insights gained from that analysis, we moved on to look in more detail at the actual reality of working with semantic resources, we opened a call for use cases, to collect examples of actual work and limitations, together with evidence of work already ongoing to address them. From that, we found that a large variety of profiles (and so skills and roles) are involved in working with semantic resources, and that there seem to be as many tools and toolkits as projects. Following the explicit suggestions provided by our respondents, we identified three types of implications of this fact, namely: Implications on software usability . Given the variety of profiles involved, tools designed for use with SRs should be accessible to non-ontologists. In particular, more attention should be payed to graphical interfaces, support for validation, and for methodological support in each task. Implications on tools availability . Reportedly, not all institutions or organizations can afford the whole set of activities associated to them, online platforms are needed to lift the burden of local (or ad-hoc) installations and maintenance from users or individuals. Implications on tools interoperability . From the use cases presented, it emerges that the different tasks commonly required to work with SR are commonly achieved by pipelines of different tools. Given this fragmented landscape, we recommend that tools to perform common tasks involving SRs (e.g. editing, format conversion, etc.) should be integrated, or integratable, to form flexible and interoperable workflows. This approach would contribute to minimizing the breadth of skills required to work with SRs. Now, we distilled our findings into a set of high level recommendations (HLR) for future activities and implementations. HLR1\u200b . \u200b Foster the development of a generic framework to work with Semantic Resources (SRs). This framework should be available online and be easily adaptable according to: the tasks to perform : Tasks along the entire lifecycle of SRs and data should be supported. Examples for SR producers include: conception, editing, update, quality check, validation, metadata creation (preferably automatic), and publication. Examples for SR consumers include: discovery, mapping, merging and annotation; the domains to cover : Users working with different domains should be able to connect to relevant SR repositories and data type registries; the user competencies required . By providing a large catalog of tools with different levels of complexity, appropriate documentation, methodological tips, and training. Such a framework should support collaborative work ,\u200b and take into particular account the needs of non-specialists of semantics, like domain experts, data managers and application developers (consuming SRs). It should encourage the \u200b reuse \u200b of existing resources whenever possible to reduce workload and increase interoperability. In order for such tools to effectively extend the framework, the appropriate licencing policy needs to be in place, to ensure the legal interoperability of the framework and the candidate tools for inclusion. The legal interoperability aspect needs to be considered since the beginning of any project or initiative. HLR2. Support initiatives aimed at developing tools and resources for alignment (semantic mapping). Activities of interest include, but are not limited to: The development of innovative tools for creating, validating, and maintaining alignments \u200b between two semantic resources or between a dataset and a semantic resource. Such tools should integrate state of art algorithms, have user-friendly GUIs,and be as integrated as possible in the working environment of the user. The promotion of a standard for expressing alignment between SR expressed in little or no machine-actionable formats . The development and long term maintenance of low-level resources 1 for common objects of interest in agriculture \u200b (e.g., species and varieties, diseases, food products) offering persistent identifiers (PIDs). Supported resources should conform to W3C recommendations and be published according to the FAIR principles. HLR3. Promote the adoption of common metadata models for the description of semantic resources and alignments, and the use of global identifiers to facilitate reuse, ensure usage tracking, and citation . \u200b This is to promote the access and reuse of semantic resources. To this end, improving information on provenance is a priority. A short set of metadata models fitted to describe semantic resources and alignments needs to be gathered and promoted. Whenever needed, existing models should be completed with adequate metadata items to allow, for instance, the production of usage metrics (if not available, they should be created). This should come with a more generalized adoption of persistent global identifiers (PIDs) at various level (e.g., the resource itself, the concepts, mappings, its creators). We do not recommend a specific PID system (as its choice also depends on the needs of the specific application and domains), but do recommend that the system chosen is widely adopted, and that the possibility of creating correspondences with other systems is taken into consideration since the beginning (especially to increase the possibility of data integration and interoperability). Shared and adapted metadata as well as persistent, global identifiers will contribute to develop better practices in reusing and citing resources in the agri-food domain. HLR4. \u200b Create courses on semantics and integrate them into curricula \u200b in computer sciences, data & information management and analytics, agronomy, bioinformatics, etc. This is the condition for a broader adoption of semantics to handle agrifood data. As semantics is needed in all steps of data life cycle, relevant knowledge and skills should be shared by all roles involved in the workflow - domain experts and software managers alike. People developing software to store, share, integrate and analyze the data must be considered as Recommendation according to profiles and roles: The recommendations given above are organized according to their area of coverage. In the following, we arrange them according the skill sets and roles that in the best position to implement them. At the same time, we also provide more details for as many recommendations as possible. 1. Developers of tools for manipulating semantic structures We wish to address software engineers, from both academia and industry, who produce tools and platforms to conceive, edit, merge, map, and share semantic resources. With these recommendations, we intend to guide them towards easier-to-use, more interoperable, smarter technologies for the benefit of non experts in particular. A table of correspondences between the more specific recommendations given below and the Requirements listed in Deliverable 2 can be found in Annex I. General recommendations Build tools that may be integrated into suits , to \u200b unburden users from tasks such as format transformation and transfer of metadata. Integratable tools should be available at all phases of the editing process, e.g., eliciting knowledge, formalization, reuse and alignment. This implies \u200b choosing standard technologies and shared input/output formats for both content representation (e.g. SKOS and TEI ) and metadata encoding. Use \u200b open source licenses that will facilitate , at a minimum, allow for the integration of your software into pipelines and public e-infrastructures. Build \u200b tools that support known best practices for the task at hand , \u200bincluding the implementation of FAIR principles, and for reusing, citing and providing SR with metadata and documentation\u200b,\u200b distinguishing conceptual from linguistic content\u200b. Implement FAIR metrics to assign level of FAIRness to SRs Provide \u200b (if possible, multilingual) documentation on your tools and toolkits\u200b . Make it possible for third parties (e.g., e-infrastructure developers) to provide user support when needed. Usability Consider non-semantic experts (e.g. biologist, agronomist) when \u200b developing tools . \u200b Tools should be user-friendly both at the level of software interaction and through graphical interfaces that use understandable terminology. \u200b Tools should smoothly support those users in a number of activities, such as bulk edits, or editing by drag & drop. A cloud-based platform (with no local installation required) also contributes to the usability of tools, especially if also collaborative features are implemented. Implement \u200b(semi)automatic generation of metadata and transfer protocols to pass metadata on from one tool to another. Duplicated effort in recording metadata at different stages of SR creation and reuse must be avoided. Features Guide users in choosing appropriate format and modelling approach to represent a SR. For example, OWL may be too expressive for a vocabulary that could be effectively modelled as a SKOS resource, and conversely, an OWL \u200bfile, \u200bdoes not necessarily imply an ontology. Allow for the \u200b customization \u200b of editing and alignment tools, such as the possibility of (de)activate features according to the nature of the SR to be edited (e.g., simple lists, thesauri, formal ontologies). Include automatic quality check \u200b on both structure and content of SR, by allowing for reuse of existing tools and algorithms (e.g. for SKOS , qSKOS and Skosify ). Connect tools or services to SR repositories in the user\u2019s domain(s) of interest in order to facilitate the reuse of resources (e.g., terms, concepts, low-resources) whenever possible, instead of creating new content. Implement notification mechanisms to inform users, both human and applications, when a new version of a SR is available. Include concept/class \u200b alignment \u200b advanced features in SR editing tools, integrate state-of-art alignment algorithms. In particular, consider the alignment of resources of different levels of expressiveness, e.g. thesauri with ontologies. Allow for collaborative evaluation \u200b of alignments. Implement the \u200b use of metadata and recording of provenance \u200b of concepts in alignment processes. Add \u200b alignment discovery services that deal with SPARQL endpoints and develop algorithms and tools to \u200b mine large sets of alignments . 2. Semantic professionals Make your SRs easily findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, by applying W3C recommendations and the FAIR principles . In particular: Share your resources in various repositories and catalogues, be they generic or domain specific; Reuse common metadata schemes for SRs, and provide adequate documentation ; Provide persistent identifiers (PIDs) to your resources, e.g. DOIs, and/or dereferenceable URIs . Publish new versions in repositories that handle versions and devise mechanisms to inform users about changes. Allow for the possibility of exposing/publishing SR at different levels of maturity (e.g., alpha, beta, with draft/proposed concepts) by providing adequate (human and machine readable) documentation. Use best practices for modelling, implementing and using SR whenever possible . \u200b For example, avoid ontology overload by keeping ontologies (knowledge models) separate from the instances (and provide mechanisms for keeping their alignment(s) in sync); preference given to smaller, modular, interoperable ontologies over monolithic structures. Reuse existing resources as much as possible (e.g., concepts, vocabularies, metadata scheme). Create new resources only if nothing reusable exist (then, try to align with related/more generic resources if possible)\u200b . Consider joining/forming a community of practice for the creation and long-term maintenance of SRs, especially for those widely used in the community. When alignments are needed, check the possibility of reusing existing \u201chubs\u201d to interconnect SRs so as to avoid the proliferation of 1-1 alignments. Promote (or, if none available, create) standards for expressing alignments between resources expressed in different formats . Develop metrics to assess resources usage . Produce recommendations and training on key issues, such as: collaborative work, e.g., intellectual properties and licenses, modeling and use of provenance information; reusing (parts of) resources to create new ones . Communicate \u200b the benefits of semantics through case studies, best practices, lessons learned, shared experiences, success stories. 3. Developers of tools/platforms consuming SRs Stay abreast of development in semantic technologies . Include functionalities for searching, discovering, documenting, visualizing, etc., data according to the SR used. Integrate semantics (features and resources) into mainstream tools and services (data repositories, analysis platforms, extract-transform-load tools...) to describe, annotate and/or structure data and services. It is particularly important that data collection tools utilize shared, machine actionnable semantics for data structuring and documentation. When possible, implement semantically enabled data types into data, tools and services to describe common data features used in agriculture and nutrition, e.g. measure units, parameters for experimental or observational data, soil properties, etc. Support conversion of data to and from RDF\u200b (import/export) .\u200b In particular: covering the most widely used formats, according to appropriate, normative, semantic models (eg INSPIRE) in a reproducible manner. 4. Data managers, data producers Stay abreast of development in semantic technologies . Make explicit (searchable and findable) what SR(s) are used within your dataset . To this end, pay special attention to the associated metadata scheme, and chose those that also allow for the description of the SR used. When not available, develop semantically enabled data types for common features used to describe data in agriculture and nutrition, e.g. measure units, parameters for experimental or observational data, soil properties, etc. Prefer data collection tools which support semantically enabled data types to structure and document the data. If alignment/mapping between datasets are created, provide documentation for the processes as well as for the result . 5. Policy makers & Funders Foster the development of a generic, extensible and web-based, framework to work with Semantic Resources . Encourage and support the creation and long term maintenance of open\u200b tools to manipulate semantic resources . Support initiatives to increase the \u200b discoverability of resources, including both datasets and semantic resources and services (e.g., concepts, mappings, SPARQL endpoints, ..). Support the creation and long-term maintenance of resources of strategic importance, 7 such as low-level resources relevant to the domain (e.g., crops, plant and animal diseases, livestock, grazing activities). These resources should be: available online and in various formats with PID like URIs, DOIs, with rich metadata With the aim to make the technology more available, promote courses and trainings on semantics (e.g., on theoretical foundations, modelling, use and implementation of tools), to be proposed either as stand-alone courses, or included in discipline-specific education programs. 1 Reference lists of entities to be used in conjunction with ontologies (i.e., corresponding to instances of ontologies). To this end, it is essential that those lists be provided with global identifiers, to enable programmatic reuse in applications. Examples of low-level resources in agriculture include lists of crops, livestock, pests, diseases, or agricultural activities","title":"Recommendations"},{"location":"agsem_recommendations/#39-hints-to-facilitate-the-use-of-semantics-for-data-on-agriculture-and-nutrition","text":"","title":"39 Hints to Facilitate the Use of Semantics for Data on Agriculture and Nutrition"},{"location":"agsem_recommendations/#recommendations-from-the-rda-agrisemantics-working-group","text":"This document presents the recommendations of the RDA Agrisemantics Working Group (WG) to promote the use of semantics for agricultural data for the purpose of enhancing data interoperability in agriculture.

(Different language tags for a given language, such as en-us and en-gb , designate separate languages.) All labels in a given language -- preferred, alternative, or designated as scientific name -- are unique strings. Alternative labels are optional; hidden labels, though part of SKOS, are not used.","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"definitions/","text":"In GACS: Definitions are provided, where needed, to help users understand the meaning of a concept and decide on its use. There is no requirement that a concept have a definition. A definition must be consistent with the position of a concept in the hierarchy of concepts. A definition differs from a scope note, which focuses on what differentiates the concept in question from other concepts. A concept may have one or more definitions, and each definition may be expressed in one or more languages. Additional definitions need only be corrected or removed if they are in conflict with each other or with the hierarchy. (In GACS 4.0, many concepts have two or three definitions inherited from AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT.) A definition consists of a narrative explanation -- the actual definition -- plus a mandatory indication of source. Editors of GACS are encouraged to paraphrase from available sources in writing definitions, taking care not to re-use exact wordings unless the words in question are in the public domain. Where a definition has been written by a GACS editor, the most salient source of inspiration for the definition should be cited, where applicable, or by default the source cited should be \"GACS Editors\". A definition may be quoted from a source in the public domain. Only in rare cases, at the discretion of a GACS editor, should a definition be quoted from a copyrighted source. A definition should be stated as clearly and objectively as possible without erroneously limiting the concept to a specific discipline. For definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, the original indication of source in AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, are retained in GACS. Definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT that lack such an indication of source will be assigned a default source of \"AGROVOC Editors\", \"NALT Editors\", or \"CABT Editors\". [For discussion: URIs could be minted for teams of editors.] In cases where a GACS concept has inherited more than one definition, those definitions should be kept as long as they do not repeat or conflict. The source of a definition should not be cited in-line, in the manner of a journal article, but recorded in a separate source field. The source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a literal citation. Such citations should supply enough information to identify the version or edition of a source without ambiguity. The source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a URI which, in the judgement of the GACS editor, is likely to remain stable over time. A URI should not, for example, point to a Web search box or rely on the resolution of an embedded database query.","title":"Concept definitions"},{"location":"labels/","text":"In GACS, concepts are labeled with natural-language phrases. Concept labels, or \"terms\", are preferred or alternative. Preferred terms can be used as tags for subject indexing (as \"descriptors\"). The precision of term-based indexing depends on the uniqueness of the strings used to encode the terms. In production environments, for example when thesauri are used in complex workflows, it is important that preferred terms also remain stable. Terms other than preferred terms are non-preferred, or alternative (\"non-descriptors\"). Because non-descriptors are used to direct users to preferred terms, they are also known as \"lead-in-terminology\". In standard thesaurus practice, non-descriptors are not used to tag resources for indexing and retrieval. In accordance with thesaurus practice, SKOS prescribes that concepts not have two preferred labels in a given language and recommends that preferred labels in a given language be unique within the context of a given concept scheme (e.g., that no two concepts share the prefLabel \"lime\"@en). In accordance with the SKOS specification, it is an error if a concept has a same literal both as its preferred label and as an alternative label. In GACS: Preferred labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS. That is, one concept MUST NOT have the same preferred label as another concept in the same (core) language. Note: \"unique\" is case insensitive. Preferred labels SHOULD be unique for the other (non-core) languages of GACS. That is, one concept SHOULD NOT have the same preferred label as another concept in the same (non-core) language. In core languages, an alternate label MUST NOT be identical to a preferred label of another concept. In other (non-core) languages, an alternate label SHOULD NOT be identical to a preferred label of another concept. Alternate labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS. That is, one concept MUST NOT have the same alternate label as another concept in the same (core) language. Alternate labels SHOULD be unique for the other (non-core) languages of GACS. That is, one concept SHOULD NOT have the same alternate label as another concept in the same (non-core) language.","title":"Concept labels"},{"location":"names/","text":"Concepts of type \"organism\" are 29% of GACS Beta 1.6. Of these, over 83% have a scientific name as prefLabel. The remaining 17% includes: common names : goats, lizards, ducks, shrimps, honey bees, mangolds. names of organism groups : young animals, plant parasitic nematodes, aquatic insects, small ruminants, farmed fish, macroinvertebrates, racing animals, rodents, pets, cash crops. names of special kinds of organism : stallions, kids, weanlings, bitches, beef bulls, yearlings, ewes, ducklings, germ-free animals, herds, fish larvae. The scientific names of organisms are markedly \"translinguistic\" -- i.e., they are often used unchanged across a broad range of world languages. Scientific names may be expressed as \"Latinate\" (Latin or Latin-like) phrases, such as \"Tsuga canadensis\" or \"Picea engelmannii\". Exceptions include viruses, which are translingually named in English, e.g., \"Foot-and-mouth disease virus\". If the goal of GACS were to provide a definitive database for species or taxons, it might follow relevant standards such as Darwin Core, which designates scientific names with a special property. In order to meet the simpler use cases of bibliographic indexing, GACS follows the thesaurus paradigm of concepts with preferred and alternate labels. Insofar as scientific names are translingual, they are considered in GACS as belonging to no language in particular. Labels with scientific names are tagged with a code, 'zxx', defined in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 for content that is not specific to any language (@cite). In GACS, the distinction between preferred and alternative labels is largely orthogonal to the distinction between scientific and common names. A scientific name may be the preferred label (e.g., \"Leptinotarsa decemlineata\") and the corresponding common name the alternative (\"Colorado potato beetle\"). Vice versa, the common name may be preferred (\"dogs\") and the scientific name alternative (\"Canis lupus familiaris\"). For example: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Condition | prefLabel | altLabel | |------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| | 1:1 Common to Species Name | __Species__ | __Common__ | | | Leptinotarsa decemlineata | Colorado potato beetle | | | Camelus bactrianus | Bactrian camel | | | Quercus rubra | Northern red oak | | 1:N Common to Species Name | __Species__ | __Common__ | | | Campanula | Bluebells | | | Barleria | | | | Mertensia | | | | Eustoma | | | | Hyacinthoides | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lori Finch prepared a note about common names and Latin names in GACS .","title":"Scientific and common names"},{"location":"reference/","text":"GACS Reference material [1] T.

The concept alfalfa , for example, is defined by relations such as: alfalfa hasType Product alfalfa BT legumes alfalfa RT fodder plants fodder plants RT livestock feeding fodder plants RT forage fodder plants RT hay These relations are reflected in the GACS definition of alfalfa as: \"A valuable leguminous crop for forage or hay used in livestock feeding \". However, less than 20% of the concepts in GACS have definitions, and crafting definitions for the other 80% would be expensive, especially across translations in multiple languages. Moreover, narrative definitions are less useful than semantic relations for automated processing because relations between concepts can only roughly be computed from label strings, sentence parsing, and the co-occurrence of words. Explicit semantic relations provide a basis for browsing broader, narrower, or related concepts and for expanding queries. They can be used to disambiguate meanings and to check concept hierarchies for consistency. Because they cluster related examples, they are less vulnerable than definitions to misinterpretation by translators. In GACS, definitions are \"nice to have\", but semantic relations are essential. For maintainability, the set of semantic relations used in GACS has been kept as simple and obvious as possible. Broader, narrower, and related concepts GACS concepts are linked among themselves with related , broader , and narrower relations as defined in SKOS, which are themselves based on standard thesaurus relations ( RT , BT , and NT ). Broader and narrower do not formally distinguish between \"is a\" and \"part of\" relations. In GACS, broader and narrower are generally intended to imply general-to-specific \"is a\" relations, though not in a formally strict ontological sense, and there are plenty of exceptions (for example, Maryland , which is \"part of\" the North Eastern States (USA) ). Top-level concepts All concepts in GACS are grouped under three concepts that have no broader concepts (top-level concepts): Objects : material things that can be seen, touched, visited (locations), including conceptual objects such as ideas and models. Events and actions : things that happen, such as processes or phenomena. Properties : attributes, characteristics, or qualities of things. In thesaurus practice, top concepts are typically intended for use in faceted browsing or in creating microthesauri. In GACS, the top concepts can be used as entry points for browsing GACS by thematic group in the Hierarchy tab of the Skosmos browser. The top concepts are too abstract to be used for indexing. Concepts further down in the hierarchy are more concrete and more useful both for indexing and for clarifying meanings (disambiguation). While a certain amount of polyhierarchy (where concepts have more than one broader concept) may be inevitable, even desirable, it seems unrealistic to expect that a complex polyhierarchy could be enforced and maintained in a principled way and at scale. For GACS, the goal is to to keep the hierarchy simple, and as close to the ideal of cascading \"is a\" relations, as pragmatically possible. Concept types Differentiating between types of concept can help clarify the meaning of concepts across the hierarchy. While top concepts, with their hierarchies, might in principle be used to group concepts by the type of thing they represent, such as \"organisms\", the GACS hierarchy does not follow the principle of general-to-specific (hyponymy) strictly enough to ensure that \"is a\" (\"type of\") relations always hold; the hierarchy also contains \"part of\" (meronym) relations. The GACS Working Group opted to explore the usefulness of concept types by creating types of SKOS concept for just four particularly obvious and clearly defined types of things: Chemical , Geographical , Organism , and Product , with Topic as a fifth \"catch-all\" type for all concepts not otherwise covered (and with the expectation that Topic might be further differentiated over time). Custom (non-SKOS) relations between concepts Some thesauri, such as AGROVOC and CAB Thesaurus, use semantic relations beyond standard SKOS properties to express more specific relations between concepts. However, efforts to \"ontologize\" thesauri with such additional relations struggle to ensure that the properties would be applied consistently, comprehensively, and maintainably. The GACS Working Group decided that custom relations should only be created for use cases important enough to justify the effort. Two properties qualified: hasProduct and productOf , for relating fish as a product to fish as an organism . Mapping to concepts in external vocabularies GACS was created at the intersection of three existing thesauri, and each concept in GACS has a SKOS \"exact match\" relation back to the concept or concepts in AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT from which it was created. In addition, the 540 concepts of type Geographical have SKOS \"close match\" relations to entities in Wikidata. These mappings facilitate access from GACS to Wikidata information about geographic places (such as coordinates, population, language, and religions); to Wikidata mappings out to other geo-oriented vocabularies such as GeoNames and OpenStreetMap; and to mappings out to library-oriented authority files such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File, GND (German union authority), BNF, VIAF and ISNI. As an example, see the Wikidata entry for Alberta ) and the corresponding GACS concept . This exercise suggests a model by which GACS might, in the future, devolve or delegate responsibility for specific types of GACS concepts to external authorities. Geographic places are an obvious candidate for delegation because they are not specific to agriculture and because they have been given URIs in so many other sources. Once mapped to a external source, a given set of GACS concepts could be reduced to a set of URIs clearly marked as dependent on the external URIs, and the GACS community could promote the use of the external URIs. GACS concepts cannot simply be deleted because their URIs must be credibly persistent, in accordance with explicit policies, if GACS itself is to be credibly deployable.

As a SKOS concept scheme, GACS identifies its concepts with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for use in Linked Data. GACS Beta 3.1, published in May 2016 with 15,000 concepts and 350,000 terms (labels) in over 25 languages, will soon be superseded by GACS 4.0 , the result of a recent GACS Quality Improvement Project . Created since 2014 on the initiative of three organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), and the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL), GACS was formed at the intersection of most-frequently-used concepts from their three respective thesauri -- the AGROVOC Concept Scheme , CAB Thesaurus , and the NAL Thesaurus , for which GACS provides a mapping hub. GACS is seen as an important step towards linking and integrating agricultural data of all types to address the long-term challenge of global food security. The GACS community of maintenance organizations is growing. The GACS community aspires to build collaboration with expert providers of concept URIs in specific areas such as species, viruses, chemicals, and geographic places.","title":"Gacs"},{"location":"arch/guidelines/","text":"This website documents the principles and guidelines used to maintain the Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS).
