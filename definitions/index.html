    <p>In GACS:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Definitions are provided, where needed, to help users understand
   the meaning of a concept and decide on its use.  There is no requirement
   that a concept have a definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition must be consistent with the position of a concept in the 
   hierarchy of concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition differs from a scope note, which focuses on what differentiates
   the concept in question from other concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A concept may have one or more definitions, and each definition may be
   expressed in one or more languages.   Additional definitions need only be
   corrected or removed if they are in conflict with each other or with the
   hierarchy.  (In GACS 4.0, many concepts have two or three definitions
   inherited from AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition consists of a narrative explanation -- the actual definition --
   plus a mandatory indication of source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Editors of GACS are encouraged to paraphrase from available sources 
   in writing definitions, taking care not to re-use exact wordings unless
   the words in question are in the public domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a definition has been written by a GACS editor, the most salient
   source of inspiration for the definition should be cited, where applicable,
   or by default the source cited should be "GACS Editors".  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition may be quoted from a source in the public domain.  Only in 
   rare cases, at the discretion of a GACS editor, should a definition be 
   quoted from a copyrighted source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition should be stated as clearly and objectively as possible 
   without erroneously limiting the concept to a specific discipline.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, the original 
    indication of source in AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, are retained in 
    GACS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT that lack such an
    indication of source will be assigned a default source of "AGROVOC 
    Editors", "NALT Editors", or "CABT Editors".  [For discussion: URIs 
    could be minted for teams of editors.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where a GACS concept has inherited more than one 
    definition, those definitions should be kept as long as they do not 
    repeat or conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source of a definition should not be cited in-line, in the manner 
    of a journal article, but recorded in a separate source field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a literal
    citation.  Such citations should supply enough information to identify
    the version or edition of a source without ambiguity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a URI which,
    in the judgement of the GACS editor, is likely to remain stable over time.
    A URI should not, for example, point to a Web search box or rely on the 
    resolution of an embedded database query.</p>
</li>
</ol>
